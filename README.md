## Hello!! >_<

It's quite obvious from my profile that Dottore is my favorite fictional character in general,mostly because of his well written villainy and such,but overall i enjoy every character I'm in the fandom of!

I'm quite open-minded and wouldn't mind getting to know anyone as long as they're not someone who'd make people uncomfortable, I'd prefer if you don't try to open up too quickly since that gets me annoyed easily. 

I'm empathetic,often knowing how to understand people's feelings in something,and I don't mind vents by friends and never disliked it at all. I'm emotionally intelligent,since I've been studying how human emotions work for over a year now.

My hobbies are listening to music,drawing, designing,creating metaphors,world building with OCs,exploring mentalities,and writing,and I wouldn't mind having new experiences at all if it's something enjoyable!

Dni if you make people uncomfortable or threatened in any way for any valid reason.

I like to be in the fandoms of:

- Bad things
- Genshin Impact
- Honkai Star Rail
- Cookie Run Kingdom
- Almost anything Greek mythology related (other than Lore Olympus)
- Forsaken 
- Regretevator
- Termination Protocol

, Aaand etc.
